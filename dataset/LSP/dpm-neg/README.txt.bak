This folder contains cropped background images originating from the
uncropped Leeds Sports Pose Dataset (LSP). The crops were extracted
from images cotaining at most one annotated person outside of the
person bouding box. This negative set should be used to train DPM body
part detectors to reproduce the results from the paper
